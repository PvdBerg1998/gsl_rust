# gsl_rust

This is a safe Rust wrapper around the GSL.

It only supports a tiny subset of the API which I need for private projects. I decided to write my own after endless struggling with missing API's and UB in [rust-GSL](https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/rust-GSL).

GSL is bundled and gets statically linked.
